# Scenario A: Request for an Excused Absence Due to Injury


Hi John,

Thank you for informing us about your situation. I am sorry to hear about your injury, and I hope you are feeling better.

Since this is your second absence, and you mentioned having proof of medical appointment, we can process this as an excused absence. Kindly share the documentation, such as doctorâ€™s note or medical report, confirming the reason for your absence.

Once we receive proof, we will update your attendance record accordingly. Please remember that students are only allowed up to three absences throughout the course duration.

If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to reach out.
Wishing you a speedy recovery.

All the best,

CodePath Support
