# Scenario C: Student Submitted their Assignment Late

Hi Lara,

Thank you for reaching out and for sharing the challenges you are currently facing. I appreciate your dedication to balancing your academic and personal responsibilities during this difficult time.

As per the course policy, all students are provided with a 48-hour extension period after the original submission deadline to accommodate unforeseen circumstances. Since you have reached out shortly after this period, I am able to grant you a 48-hour extension to submit Project 6.  Please ensure the assignment is submitted no later than **Sunday 11:59PM**.

Your commitment to this course is evident, and I encourage you to continue making progress despite the challenges. Should you require further time beyond this extension, please reach out, and we can consult our Programs team to explore additional options. Please note, however, that the maximum extension we can offer is one-week from the original deadline.

Thank you for your understanding, and I hope your situation improves soon. Please donâ€™t hesitate to let us know if you need any additional support.

All the best,

CodePath Support
