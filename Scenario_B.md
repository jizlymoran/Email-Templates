**Scenario B: Request for an Excused Absence Due to Family Emergency**

Hi Mary,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your situation. I am very sorry to hear about your family emergency and I hope your family member is recovering well.

Since this is your first absence and the reason qualifies for an excused absence under our policy, we can approve your request. Please note that the students are only allowed up to three excused absences during the course, so this will not count against your remaining unexcused absences.

We appreciate your commitment to the course, and we are here to support you as you continue with your studies. Should you have any further questions, feel free to reach out.

<br>

All the best,

CodePath Support
