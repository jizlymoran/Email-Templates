# Scenario D: Request for a Deadline Extension

Hi Alice,

Thank you for reaching out and letting us know about your situation. I am sorry to hear about the trouble with your MacBook, and I appreciate your proactive approach in addressing this issue.

Since this is your first request for a deadline extension, I am happy to approve your request. The new deadline for your assignment will be extended until **October 12 11:59PM**.

Please use this additional time to complete your coursework, and if you encounter any further challenges, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. If you have documentation related to your laptop issue and would like to provide it, feel free to share it for our records, though it is not required for this extension.

Thank you for your commitment to the course, and I wish you the best as you resolve this situation.

All the best,
