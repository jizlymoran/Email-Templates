# Scenario E: Student is Unable to Join the Zoom Session

Hi Allen,

Thank you for reaching out, and I am sorry to hear about the difficulty you are experiencing with joining the session. Let’s work to resolve this as quickly as possible.

Here are a few steps you can try first:

1. **Confirm the correct session link:** Double-check the Zoom link for your cohort in the course portal to ensure you’re using the right one.
2. **Check your GitHub account:** Ensure that you’re logged into the GitHub account associated with your course registration.
3. **Clear cache:** If you still can’t join, clear your browser cache or try accessing the link in an incognito/ private browser.


Please use this  [guide](https://www.guide.com) for a detailed discussion of each step. If these steps don’t resolve the issue, please let me know, and I will provide you with direct access to the Zoom session.

We want to make sure you don’t miss out on today’s class, so please update me on your progress with troubleshooting,



<br>

All the best,

CodePath Support
